(Source: Radiation Protection Regulations ) Note 1: Effective dose is a measure of the total detriment, or risk, due to an exposure to ionizing radiation. If the exposure to different organs or tissues is not uniform (as is the case when radionuclides are deposited in the body), the concept of effective dose is used. The basic idea is to express the risk from the exposure to a single organ or tissue in terms of the equivalent risk from an exposure to the whole body. The unit of effective dose is the sievert. Note 2: Equivalent dose and effective dose are protection quantities used to reflect how radiation exposure can affect overall health of the human body. They specify dose values, which are derived from the body's absorbed dose, for limiting the occurrence of stochastic health effects below acceptable levels and avoiding tissue reactions. The effective dose is designed to reflect these differences and how exposure can affect overall health of the whole body. Note 3: The term weighting factor refers to the tissue weighting factor, which takes into account that different organs and tissue have different radiation sensitivities. For example, bone marrow is much more radiosensitive than muscle or nerve tissue. Effective dose is the summation of the tissue equivalent doses, each multiplied by the appropriate tissue weighting factor. It is defined by: E = ∑ T w T ∑ R w R D T , R where w T is the tissue weighting factor with ∑w T = 1. The sum is performed over all organs and tissues considered in the definition of E. Note 4: Use of absorbed dose alone is not valid for estimating risk, as radiation effects depend not only on the absorbed dose but also on a) the type of radiation, b) the distribution of energy absorption in time and space within the human body and c) the radiosensitivity of the exposed tissues or organs.

Licensee non-compliances or performance issues, if any, are not risk-significant. Any non-compliances or performance issues have been, or are being, adequately corrected. Below expectations (BE) : One or more of the following criteria apply: Performance does not meet CNSC staff expectations. The licensee has risk-significant non-compliance(s) or performance issue(s). Non-compliances or performance issues are not being adequately corrected. Unacceptable (UA) : One or both of the following criteria apply: The risk associated with a non-compliance or performance issue is unreasonable. At least one significant non-compliance or performance issue exists with no associated corrective action. The rating levels above replace the following: Fully satisfactory (FS) : Safety and control measures implemented by the licensee are highly effective. In addition, compliance with regulatory requirements is fully satisfactory and compliance within the safety and control area (SCA) or specific area exceeds requirements and CNSC expectations. Overall, compliance is stable or improving, and any problems or issues that arise are promptly addressed. Satisfactory (SA) : Safety and control measures implemented by the licensee are sufficiently effective. In addition, compliance with regulatory requirements is satisfactory. Compliance within the SCA or specific area meets requirements and CNSC expectations. Any deviation is minor, and any issues are considered to pose a low risk to the achievement of regulatory objectives and CNSC expectations. Appropriate improvements are planned. Below expectations (BE) : Safety and control measures implemented by the licensee are marginally ineffective. In addition, compliance with regulatory requirements falls below expectations. Compliance within the SCA deviates from requirements or CNSC expectations to the extent that there is a moderate risk of ultimate failure to comply. Improvements are required to address identified weaknesses. The licensee is taking appropriate corrective action. Unacceptable (UA) : Safety and control measures implemented by the licensee are significantly ineffective. In addition, compliance with regulatory requirements is unacceptable and is seriously compromised. Compliance within the SCA is significantly below requirements or CNSC expectations, or there is evidence of overall non-compliance.
