(Source: Radiation Protection Regulations ) Note 1: Effective dose is a measure of the total detriment, or risk, due to an exposure to ionizing radiation. If the exposure to different organs or tissues is not uniform (as is the case when radionuclides are deposited in the body), the concept of effective dose is used. The basic idea is to express the risk from the exposure to a single organ or tissue in terms of the equivalent risk from an exposure to the whole body. The unit of effective dose is the sievert. Note 2: Equivalent dose and effective dose are protection quantities used to reflect how radiation exposure can affect overall health of the human body. They specify dose values, which are derived from the body's absorbed dose, for limiting the occurrence of stochastic health effects below acceptable levels and avoiding tissue reactions. The effective dose is designed to reflect these differences and how exposure can affect overall health of the whole body. Note 3: The term weighting factor refers to the tissue weighting factor, which takes into account that different organs and tissue have different radiation sensitivities. For example, bone marrow is much more radiosensitive than muscle or nerve tissue. Effective dose is the summation of the tissue equivalent doses, each multiplied by the appropriate tissue weighting factor. It is defined by: E = ∑ T w T ∑ R w R D T , R where w T is the tissue weighting factor with ∑w T = 1. The sum is performed over all organs and tissues considered in the definition of E. Note 4: Use of absorbed dose alone is not valid for estimating risk, as radiation effects depend not only on the absorbed dose but also on a) the type of radiation, b) the distribution of energy absorption in time and space within the human body and c) the radiosensitivity of the exposed tissues or organs.

The NEA’s current membership consists of 33 countries in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region, which account for about 85 percent of the world’s installed nuclear capacity. The OECD is an intergovernmental organization, based in Paris, France, that provides a forum for discussion and cooperation among the governments of industrialized countries committed to democracy and the market economy.',\n",

       " 'Nuclear Material Management and Safeguards System (NMMSS)': 'A centralized U.S. Government database used to track and account for source and special nuclear material. The system contains current and historical data on the possession, use, and shipment of source and special nuclear material within the United States, as well as all exports and imports of such material. The database is jointly funded by the NRC and DOE and is operated under a DOE contract.',\n",

       " 'Nuclear poison (or neutron poison)': 'In reactor physics, a substance (other than fissionable material ) that has a large capacity for absorbing neutrons in the vicinity of the reactor core . This effect may be undesirable in some reactor applications because it may prevent or disrupt the fission chain reaction , thereby affecting normal operation. However, neutron-absorbing materials (commonly known as \"poisons\") are intentionally inserted into some types of reactors to decrease the reactivity of their initial fresh fuel load. (Adding poisons, such as control rods or boron, is described as adding \" negative reactivity \" to the reactor.)',\n",
       " 'Nuclear power plant': 'A thermal power plant, in which the energy (heat) released by the fissioning of nuclear fuel is used to boil water to produce steam. The steam spins the propeller-like blades of a turbine that turns the shaft of a generator to produce electricity. Of the various nuclear power plant designs, pressurized- water reactors and boiling-water reactors are in commercial operation in the United States. These facilities generate about 20 percent of U.S. electrical power.',\n",

For additional detail, please see the NRC Incident Response Plan (NUREG-0728) .',\n",
       " 'Nuclear reactor': 'The heart of a nuclear power plant or nonpower reactor , in which nuclear fission may be initiated and controlled in a self-sustaining chain reaction to generate energy or produce useful radiation. Although there are many types of nuclear reactors, they all incorporate certain essential features, including the use of fissionable material as fuel, a moderator (such as water) to increase the likelihood of fission (unless reactor operation relies on fast neutrons), a reflector to conserve escaping neutrons , coolant provisions for heat removal, instruments for monitoring and controlling reactor operation, and protective devices (such as control rods and shielding ).

Specifically, these stages produce a variety of nuclear waste materials, including uranium mill tailings , depleted uranium , and spent (depleted) fuel , all of which are regulated by the NRC. (By contrast, \"radioactive waste\" is a broader term, which includes all wastes that contain radioactivity , regardless of how they are produced. It is not considered \"nuclear waste\" because it is not produced through the nuclear fuel cycle and is generally not regulated by the NRC.)',\n",
       " 'Nucleon': 'Common name for a constituent particle of the atomic nucleus. At present, applied to protons and neutrons, but may include any other particles found to exist in the nucleus.',\n",
       " 'Nucleus': 'The small, central, positively charged region of an atom. Except for the nucleus of ordinary hydrogen, which has only a proton, all atomic nuclei contain both protons and neutrons. The number of protons determines the total positive charge or atomic number. This number is the same for all the atomic nuclei of a given chemical element. The total number of neutrons and protons is called the mass number.',\n",
