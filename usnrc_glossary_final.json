As a result, fissile materials (such as uranium-235) are a subset of fissionable materials. Uranium-235 fissions with low-energy thermal neutrons because the binding energy resulting from the absorption of a neutron is greater than the critical energy required for fission; therefore uranium-235 is a fissile material. By contrast, the binding energy released by uranium-238 absorbing a thermal neutron is less than the critical energy, so the neutron must possess additional energy for fission to be possible.

Compared to non-ionizing radiation, such as radio- or microwaves, or visible, infrared, or ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation is considerably more energetic. When ionizing radiation passes through material such as air, water, or living tissue, it deposits enough energy to produce ions by breaking molecular bonds and displace (or remove) electrons from atoms or molecules. This electron displacement may lead to changes in living cells. Given this ability, ionizing radiation has a number of beneficial uses, including treating cancer or sterilizing medical equipment. However, ionizing radiation is potentially harmful if not used correctly, and high doses may result in severe skin or tissue damage. It is for this reason that the NRC strictly regulates commercial and institutional uses of the various types of ionizing radiation. Radiation, as used in 10 CFR Part 20 , does not include non-ionizing radiation (see also 10 CFR 20.1003 ).",

Those who survive six weeks after the receipt of a single large dose of radiation to the whole body may generally be expected to recover.",
  "Radiation source": "A radioactive material or byproduct that is specifically manufactured or obtained for the purpose of using the emitted radiation. Such sources are commonly used in teletherapy or industrial radiography ; in various types of industrial gauges , irradiators , and gamma knives ; and as power sources for batteries (such as those used in spacecraft). These sources usually consist of a known quantity of radioactive material, which is encased in a manmade capsule, sealed between layers of nonradioactive material, or firmly bonded to a nonradioactive substrate to prevent radiation leakage. Other radiation sources include devices such as accelerators and x-ray generators.",
  "Radiation standards": "Exposure limits; permissible concentrations; rules for safe handling; and regulations regarding receipt, possession, use, transportation, storage, disposal, and industrial control of radioactive material.

  "Radiation therapy (radiotherapy)": "The therapeutic use of ionizing radiation to treat disease in patients. Although most radiotherapy procedures are intended to kill cancerous tissue or reduce the size of a tumor, therapeutic doses may also be used to reduce pain or treat benign conditions. For example, intervascular brachytherapy uses radiation to treat clogged blood vessels. Other common radiotherapy procedures include gamma stereotactic radiosurgery ( gamma knife ), teletherapy , and iodine treatment to correct an overactive thyroid gland. These procedures use radiation sources , regulated by the NRC and its Agreement States , that may be applied either inside or outside the body. In either case, the goal of radiotherapy is to deliver the required therapeutic or pain-relieving dose of radiation with high precision and for the required length of time, while preserving the surrounding healthy tissue.",
  "Radiation warning symbol": "An officially prescribed magenta or black trefoil on a yellow background, which must be displayed where certain quantities of radioactive materials are present or where certain doses of radiation could be received.",
  "Radiation, ionizing": "A form of radiation, which includes alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, x-rays, neutrons, high-speed electrons, and high-speed protons. Compared to nonionizing radiation, such as found in ultraviolet light or microwaves, ionizing radiation is considerably more energetic. When ionizing radiation passes through material such as air, water, or living tissue, it deposits enough energy to break molecular bonds and displace (or remove) electrons. This electron displacement may lead to changes in living cells. Given this ability, ionizing radiation has a number of beneficial uses, including treating cancer or sterilizing medical equipment. However, ionizing radiation is potentially harmful if not used correctly, and high doses may result in severe skin or tissue damage. It is for this reason that the NRC strictly regulates commercial and institutional uses of the various types of ionizing radiation.",
  "Radiation, nuclear": "Energy given off by matter in the form of tiny, fast-moving particles (alpha particles, beta particles, and neutrons) or pulsating electromagnetic rays or waves (gamma rays) emitted from the nuclei of unstable radioactive atoms. All matter is composed of atoms, which are made up of various parts; the nucleus contains minute particles called protons and neutrons, and the atom\u2019s outer shell contains other particles called electrons. The nucleus carries a positive electrical charge, while the electrons carry a negative electrical charge. These forces work toward a strong, stable balance by getting rid of excess atomic energy (radioactivity). In that process, unstable radioactive nuclei may emit energy, and this spontaneous emission is called nuclear radiation. All types of nuclear radiation are also ionizing radiation, but the reverse is not necessarily true; for example, x-rays are a type of ionizing radiation, but they are not nuclear radiation because they do not originate from atomic nuclei. In addition, some elements are naturally radioactive, as their nuclei emit nuclear radiation as a result of radioactive decay, but others become radioactive by being irradiated in a reactor. Naturally occurring nuclear radiation is indistinguishable from induced radiation.",
  "Radioactive contamination": "Undesirable radioactive material (with a potentially harmful effect) that is either airborne or deposited in (or on the surface of) structures, objects, soil, water, or living organisms (people, animals, or plants) in a concentration that may harm people, equipment, or the environment.",
  "Radioactive decay": "The spontaneous transformation of one radionuclide into one or more decay products (also known as \u201cdaughters\u201d). This transformation is commonly characterized by the emission of an alpha particle, a beta particle, or gamma ray photon(s) from the nucleus of the\u00a0 radionuclide. The rate at which these transformations take place, when a sufficient quantity of the same radionuclide is present, depends on the half-life of the radionuclide. Some radionuclides (e.g., hydrogen-3, also known as \u201ctritium\u201d) decay to stable daughters that are not radioactive. However, other radionuclides (e.g., uranium-238) decay to radioactive daughters (e.g., thorium-234) and may be part of a radioactive decay chain consisting of two or more radionuclides linked in a cascading series of radioactive decay.",
  "Radioactive series": "A succession of nuclides, each of which transforms by radioactive disintegration into the next until a stable nuclide results. The first member is called the parent, the intermediate members are called daughters, and the final stable member is called the end product.",
  "Radioactivity": "The property possessed by some elements (such as uranium ) of spontaneously emitting energy in the form of radiation as a result of the decay (or disintegration) of an unstable atom . Radioactivity is also the term used to describe the rate at which radioactive material emits radiation . Radioactivity is measured in curies (Ci) , becquerels (Bq) , or disintegrations per second.. For related information, see Measuring Radiation .",
  "Radiography": "The use of sealed sources of ionizing radiation for nondestructive examination of the structure of materials.

  "Radiopharmaceutical": "A pharmaceutical drug that emits radiation and is used in diagnostic or therapeutic medical procedures. Radioisotopes that have short half-lives are generally preferred to minimize the radiation dose to the patient and the risk of prolonged exposure. In most cases, these short-lived radioisotopes decay to stable elements within minutes, hours, or days, allowing patients to be released from the hospital in a relatively short time.",
  "Radiosensitivity": "The relative susceptibility of cells, tissues, organs, organisms, or other substances to the injurious action of radiation.",
